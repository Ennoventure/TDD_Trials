## 1. python-roman-numerals-kata

### Task Description
    #### Write a method String convert(int) that takes a number and converts it to the according String representation.
        */ Examples:
                1 ➔ I
                2 ➔ II
                3 ➔ III
                4 ➔ IV
                5 ➔ V
                9 ➔ IX
                21 ➔ XXI
                50 ➔ L
                100 ➔ C
                500 ➔ D
                1000 ➔ M 
        */

### Hint
    This kata lures a lot of people to implement features in the order of the numbers. But do not forget that it’s sometimes easier to start with a general case and add exceptions later.


#### Solution
    RomanNumeralsConverter.roman_converter(number) (from src/roman_number_converter.py)
    This method will help to generate the roman numberal of any integer value provided.


###### Note: This converter will generate numbers from only 1 to 3999
